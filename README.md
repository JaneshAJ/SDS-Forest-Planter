# SDS-Forest-Planter
Architecture and Design of a fully autonomous Forest Planter Robot.

This is a design project aimed at creating a fully autonomous robot system that is ussed for planting seeds in a forest which does not require human interaction in the process. 
The system was designed based on the requirements that arise during realtime. The framework is divided into the Physical, low, medium and high level architecture. The layers are divided based on the parts required, software required, algorithms used to design the whole system and technologies required. 
A detailed report has been documented on this project to create a proper design strategy of the said system.
